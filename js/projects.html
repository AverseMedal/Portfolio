                <h3><b>>>D20 War<<</b></h3>
                <p>Description: Back in Intro to Comp Sci, I made the card game war, but with a twist.
                    Instead of using Cards I used a D20 sided die that I programmed into the project to roll and whoever
                    got the higher number won!
                </p>

            <div class="project">
                <h3>>>Guess the Number Game<<</h3>
                <p>Description: When coming into Web Dev. I understood almost nothing about coding in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
                    I took what I learned and was able to make a game that had some cool effects in my opinon. Like making a GIF appear when you won!

            <div class="project">
                <h3>>>BattleShip (W.I.P)<<</h3>
                <p>Description: I have yet to make a third project I am proud enough to put on here. Something I can tell you I am working on now is a BattleShip project in 
                    OOP (Object Orientated Programming). I think when this project is done it will definitely be one of my favorites. :D
